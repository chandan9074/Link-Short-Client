## Project Overview

Every day we have to face a lot of problem to manage some of our important links. Here I solve this problem in simple way. User can easily handle those problems.

Here are some key feature of this project,

- Unathorized user can only short their long url. But they can't do any further activities.

- When an user singup in our website they can short their long url, update the short url and also delete their saved url.

- The main helpfull part is that when an authorized user logged out and after login he will be able to see their previous created short urls. But this feature only able to authorized users.
